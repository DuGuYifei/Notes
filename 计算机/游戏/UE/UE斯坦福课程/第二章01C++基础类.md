basic class hierarchy
1. **Object** - base class for all unreal objects
2. **Actor** - objects that can be placed or spawned(孵化) in the world - e.g. weapon, wall  
3. **Pawn** ((象棋)兵，马前卒，工具，典当，抵押物) - actors that can be "controlled" by players or AI - e.g. have input
4. **Character** - pawn that implements walking movement - Pawn with **walking movement code already**
5. **SCharacter** - our first C++ class (with our own prefix)
